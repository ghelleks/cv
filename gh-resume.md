**Red Hat**: *Chief Strategist, US Public Sector* __2010-2014__
  Set direction for sales and product teams in the US Federal, state, and local markets for a $1.5 billion open source technology business, contributing to an average of 20% growth YoY.

The group claims over 60 corporate members, and remains a resource for open source companies seeking advice of government regulations, as well as government agencies eager to adopt more open source projects.
